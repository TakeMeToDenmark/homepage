**CPR** (*Central Person Register*) is the number of numbers in Denmark. You need it in order to be able to get a bank account, mobile subscription, to communicate with authorities and so on. It should be one of the first things you take care of after you arrive to Denmark.

You apply for CPR number at your local citizen service centre (*‘Borgerservice’*) centre which is determined by the municipality (*kommune*) where you live. [^local-municipalities]

When you apply for CPR number you need to have:

- **residence permit/registration certificate**, except Nordic citizens
- **permanent residence in Denmark**, rental agreement, letter from your landlordor other proof of your address in Denmark
- **passport or other ID with picture**
- **Nordic CPR number**, if you are from a Nordic country
- **marriage certificate** if you are married, **children's birth certificate**, if you have children
- **blue EU health insurance card**, if you are a student

You will get the CPR number right away on the spot. Couple of weeks later you will receive your yellow health insurance card (‘*Sundhedskort*’) in the post. [^international-citizen-service]
