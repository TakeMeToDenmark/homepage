## Get involved
Long term ambition of Take Me To Denmark project is to become an ultimate crowd-sourced collection of useful information for visiting, moving and living in Denmark. Anyone who has something to share about his/her experience with this lovely scandinavian country is encouraged to do so here.

Are you an avid collector of danish vintage stamps? Do you know the best bars in town?  Always up do date with the music scene? Maybe you are more of an artsy type â€“ always know what's currently playing in theatre and when all the gallery openings are happening? As long as you have something to say and it's at least loosely-related to Denmark it can get published here. Imagine this website as an infinite canvas just waiting here for you to get your creative juices flowing.
