### Upcoming Shakespaers
Do you like expressing yourself through words? You enjoy writing stories, articles or poems in your spare time? You never feared writing essays in school? Or you simply have a story about Denmark you would like to share with the world?

Perfect! You are going to write content for the website. For now, it all goes onto the homepage. But there is also a blog-like subsite in the makings; with more casual style and loose structure to fit anything that doesn't need an entire seciton on the main homepage. Things like – personal stories, funny anecdotes, reportage from various events, reviews of books/movies and whatnot – all go here.

You can write for the website regularly, occassionaly, or only when you feel really inspired. It‘s entirely up to you.

### Internet surfers & social media freaks
Do you love procrastinating on reddit all day? You never miss out on the most interesting and entertaining articles, news, blog posts and YouTube videos? Do you spend every waking minute scrolling through your News Feed, putting quirky images on Instagram or maybe even tweet here and there? 

Great! Now you won‘t have to feel guilty about spending so much time online and finally put all that time and effort to some use. One of the roles is going to be finding, researching and curating material to be posted and used on the website. Second major role is going to be posting on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. You can choose to do only one task or all of them. What suits you.

### Creatives of all kinds, colors & sizes



#### Editorial
Are you seriously intrigued with the idea behind the website? Do you believe that it has a potential to help a lot of people? Would you like to work more closely on the project and help define its future?

It involves things like in-person meetings, brainstorming sessions, long-term plans/strategy discussions and casual meet ups over beers and crackers. You have an opportunity to become a big part of the future of Take Me To Denmark.
