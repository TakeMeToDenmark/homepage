The first step is to pick your school(s) and program(s). You are allowed to apply for **up to 8 programs**, however, you have to prioritize your choices. You can start picking your desired program by visiting the list of schools. Or maybe you prefer to browse the list of available programs first and choose the school afterwards. In either case, pick wise young padawan!

Entry requirements, necessary documentation (high school diploma, proof of english proficiency etc.), criteria for admission and other formalities depend on the school and program you picked, so you have to find out details for yourself.

<div class=“box important”>
Before starting the application process check which documentation has to be **officially certified**. Some schools may require **certified translations** of documents which are not in English or Danish. So make sure you've got those ready some time ahead of the deadline.
