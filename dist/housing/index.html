After you find out you have been admitted/hired <strong>start looking for a place immediately</strong>. Even better, start looking around earlier so you can jump right in when the time comes. Especially if you plan on staying in a student housing you should sign up for waiting lists as soon as possible.</p><p>Majority of the websites you will encounter during your apartment hunt are going to be in Danish. Even when the site has an English version don’t expect it to work properly all the time. Having a translator ready is handy when browsing offers. Google Chrome has a translating functionality built-in, or simply use <a href="http://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> or any other service of your choice.</p></article><ul class="toc"></ul><p class="updated">Page last updated on August 29, 2016</p></div></div><main class="main" role="main"><div class="wrapper-small"><article class="article"><h2>Student housing</h2><p>You may be have experienced dorm life in your homecountry. Some of you may have even built an aversion to this kind of living arrangement, regardless of wether you lived in one or not. Rest assured, student housing in Denmark is of a very high standard. In most cases a student apartment means a <strong>1-room studio apartment with your own kitchen corner and bathroom</strong>. Dorms where you share a kitchen, bathroom or both with other students are ussualy arranged so the number of people sharing the same amenities is not very large – making cohabitation smoother and easier.</p><p>Student housing is definitely <strong>the cheapest housing option</strong>. Monthly rates start around roughly 1.700 DKK (for a room without kitchen or bathroom) and can go all the way up to 8.000 DKK for a fancy, newly built, 2-3 room apartment with all the necessary amenities. Majority of dorms will offer something in between. In Copenhagen, expect to pay somewhere between <strong>2.500-5.000 DKK</strong> for a standard studio apartment with kitchen corner and small bathroom. Besides being cheaper then other options, dorms also offer a very unique social and cultural dimension, which may be worth considering.</p><p>When you go to Denmark as a full-time bachelors/masters student, you are pretty much treated just like a Dane would be when it comes to getting a room in a dorm. No special treatment or jumping ahead in the line. This means you have to sign up for a waiting list (explained below) and hope to get to the front of the cue quickly. If you are going to Denmark <strong>as an exchange student you have a priority</strong> and you are basically guaranteed to get into some student housing facility. Some schools may offer some sort of assistance for their full-time students as well, but the general rule is that you are completely on your own on this one.</p><h3>Applying for a student apartment</h3><p>Majority of student apartments in dormitories (<em>kollegium</em> in Danish) are offered through centralized portals, which make signing up for waiting lists much easier and faster. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>First thing you want to do on the website(s) is to <strong>create your personal profile</strong>. The profile is the main part of your application. It consists of basic personal information about you, your education, your living preferences, your current living situation and other necessary information.</p><p>After creating your profile you can <strong>sign up for waiting lists</strong> for individual dormitories. Dorms fall into different categories (type A, type B…) which correspond to a approximate time it will take to get to the top of the waiting list. Waiting times can range anywhere from couple of months to 3 years.</p><p>It is not explicitly clear what information exactly affects your position on the waiting list. But if you indicate that you are currently in an urgent need of housing (=homeless) one could assume you will get to the top of the list faster. If you have trouble finding a place before arriving to Denmark there is a period during summer time when it’s possible to sign up for urgent housing list (if you fulfill requirements).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p><div class="important"><p>Be aware that if you for some reason decline a certain number of offers for a place in <strong>kollegium</strong> you are going to get pushed down on the waiting list. So don’t run around signing up for every dorm you see, even though you don’t actually intend to live in them.</p></div><div class="links"><ul><li><a href="http://www.kollegierneskontor.dk">KKIK</a> - largest portal</li><li><a href="http://www.findbolig.nu">FindBolig</a> - large portal (only in Danish)</li><li><a href="http://www.housinganywhere.com/">HousingAnywhere</a> - student-to-student housing platform for exchange and internship students (you need a school email to be able to rent out)</li><li><a href="http://www.ungdomsboliger.dk/?id=navigationskort&amp;lang=en">ungdomsboliger.dk</a></li></ul></div><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>There are some facilities which operate outside these centralized systems.

It’s the quickest, you know where you stand right away, you get at least some sort of “negotiating power” and it increases your chances of scoring a place overall.</li><li><strong>Don’t wait</strong> - If you see an ad which suits your needs act right away. Starting the negotiation process is just the beginning. You will have plenty of time to think stuff over before you are in the position to actually sign a rental agreement and move into the apartment.</li><li><strong>Ask locals</strong> - Ask friends who have lived in Denmark for a while to ask around for you. People will tell you again and again that your network and contacts give you the <strong>highest chance</strong> of finding a place.</li></ul><p>Numbers bellow apply for Copenhagen. <sup id="cph-metropolitan-area-anchor"><a href="#cph-metropolitan-area" class="footnote-ref">2 Copenhagen areas</a></sup> If you are looking for a place in other cities, you can expect the prices to be lower.</p><p>There is a chance you will be lucky enough to find a place with a reasonable rent. However, generally be ready for high monthly rates. Rent for a cheap studio apartment can start around 3.500 DKK, but expect the rates for apartments to be more in the range of <strong>4.500-8.500 DKK</strong>.</p><p>Monthly rates for a room in an apartment shared with other people start somewhere around 2.500 DKK per month, but the odds are you will pay around <strong>3.000-5.000 DKK</strong>.</p><div class="box important"><div class="box-title"><i class="icon-important"></i>Important</div><p>Watch out for scammers.

You can ussualy tell that the ad is a scam if the pictures show a nice, well furnished apartment at a central location for a suspiciously low price – e.g. 2-room apartment at Christianshavn for 3.800 DKK. Some scams are better thought out then others. But if you do reply to a scam ad don't worry, it is pretty easy to tell it is a scam once the evil villain contacts you.

Not before you've seen the apartment with your own eyes and not before you've sorted out everything about the rental agreement.

Besides being cheaper, the demand should be lower too. It depends on how much are you willing to commute to school/work everyday. <em>S-Train</em> (regional train) is a pretty fast and efficient means of transport, so you can get downtown in under 30-60min from most suburban areas.</p></div></div></article><article class="article"><h2>Buying a place</h2><p>It’s common for people in Denmark to buy property. Even students own apartments; often through their parents or by getting a mortage. This is possible thanks to the concept of <em>Andelsbolig</em> (“coopearative apartmens”). Technically, you don‘t buy an apartment itself but you buy a share in the cooperative which runs and maintains the apartment building(s).<sup id="andelsbolig-anchor"><a href="#andelsbolig" class="footnote-ref">1 andelsbolig</a></sup></p><p>With a relatively low initial investment (ranging anywhere from 160.000 DKK to 1.000.000+ DKK in greater Copenhagen area) and varying “monthly tax” fee, cooperatives provide individuals, couples and families with potentially most cost-effective solution in the long-run. Instead of throwing money into thin air by renting, you get an apartment of your choice and possibly turning a profit when you sell it later on.</p><p>The idea behind <em>Andelsbolig</em> is to provide affordable housing for people to live in. The apartments are meant to be occupied primarily by its owner. It is usually possible to sublet these apartmens for shorter periods of time. However, it‘s only short-term and owner should not make a significant profit. There are laws which regulate rents and tell you how long you can live outside the aparment. It depends on the rules of your cooperative as well.</p><div class="box important"><div class="box-title"><i class="icon-important"></i>Important</div><p>Be sure to consult matters cocerning buying an apartment with professionals. You need to get economony of the cooperative checked out and all the documents and rules examined. Bank is a good start if you are taking a mortage. Hiring a legal-adcovat/lawyer is always a good idea.</p></div><p>If you have the necessary resources you should consider buying an apartment as one of the possibilities. There are many real estate agencies in Denmark. You can either personally visit agencies‘ store, which are virtually on every corner, or simply browse apartments online.</p><div class="box links"><div class="box-title"><i class="icon-link"></i>Links</div><ul><li><a href="http://www.nybolig.dk/" target="_blank"><b>nybolig.dk</b></a> - Nybolig‘s website aggregates apartments for sale from many other real estate agencies (including their own), so you don't have to check every one individually.

This purchase is not the same as buying property and you do not get the same tax-deductions and advantages as when buying a property, what you are buying is a share and the right to live in and use said property, you still pay houserent, although it is usually lower than an apartment houserent.</p><p>Together with the other members you have to agree upon the upkeep of the building, the rules etc. You are also responsible for maintainance. And you are, together with the others, responsible for any debts in the property etc. This means that you have to be very careful and make sure that you buy a "share" in a economically sound "andelsboligforening." If lots of houses/apartments in it are empty, then you will be paying for the upkeep and maintainance of these, and not just the one you are living in, and this can get expensive. Since you are also in a way becoming a member of a collective, it is important that you agree with the existing rules and get along with the other members.</p><p>The original idea behind an "Andelsbolig" was to give the lower middle-class an opportunity for better housing with a lower houserent.</p><p>While not entirely correct, you could say that it lies somewhere between renting and buying. So it has nothing to do with co-habitation as in 2 people sharing an apartment. You are multiple people with each your own apartment/house, sharing the combined property.”</p></div></div></article><article class="article"><h2>Short-term accomodation</h2><p>Your semester or first day at a new job is about to start and you have trouble finding a place prior to your arrival to Denmark? There are few temporal solutions out there. You can look for a place to live while you are already in Denmark.</p><p>There are many youth hostels in Copenhagen. They will cost you less then a hotel or bed-and-breakfast. However sleeping with 4+ people in one room and lack of privacy can get quite frustrating pretty quickly. It is a good short-term solution, but it’s not recommended for stays longer than 1-3 weeks.</p><p>The most comfortable short-term solution is private apartment or a room. This option can get a bit pricey. However, if the situation demands it, it is still a way better and cheaper option than a hotel. You also get access to a proper kitchen, meaning you don’t have to spend that much money on eating out.</p><div class="box links"><div class="box-title"><i class="icon-link"></i>Links</div><ul><li><a href="http://www.wimdu.com/" target="_blank"><b>wimdu.com</b></a> - apartments and private rooms</li><li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank"><b>airbnb.com</b></a> - apartments and private rooms</li><li><a href="http://www.danhostel.dk/en" target="_blank"><b>danhostel.dk</b></a> - hostels</li><li><a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hostels/Copenhagen/Denmark" target="_blank"><b>hostelworld.com</b></a> - hostels</li><li><a href="http://www.hostels.com/" target="_blank"><b>hostels.com</b></a> - hostels</li><li><a href="http://www.bedandbreakfast.dk/?country=358&language=13&s=Denmark" target="_blank"><b>bedandbreakfast.dk</b></a> - hostels</li><li><a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/" target="_blank"><b>couchsurfing.org</b></a> - crash on someone’s couch</li><li><a href="http://flat-club.com/" target="_blank"><b>flat-club.com</b></a> - apartments and private rooms</li></ul></div></article></div></main><a href="#top-of-the-page" class="back-to-top" title="Go back to top of this page"><img src="/assets/img/icons/arrow-up.svg" alt="arrow up icon"><span class="visually-hidden">Go back to top of this page</span></a><div class="wrapper"><section class="suggestion"><div class="suggestion__text"><h2 class="suggestion__title toc-ignore">Help us improve the site!</h2><p>Please send us your suggestions for what would you like to see on the website in the future.</p></div><div class="suggestion__image"><img src="/assets/img/icons/comment.svg" alt="comment icon"></div><div class="suggestion__activate"><span class="btn">Write a message</span></div><div class="suggestion__slide"><form id="message-form" method="POST" class="message"><div class="form-item message__name"><label for="name">Your name</label><input type="text" name="name" class="name" required></div><div class="form-item message__email"><label for="_replyto">Your email</label><input type="email" name="_replyto" required></div><div class="form-item message__text"><label for="message">Your message</label><textarea rows="8" name="message" required></textarea></div><input type="text" name="_gotcha" style="display:none"> <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="Message from TMTD"><div class="message__button"><input type="submit" value="Send message" class="btn"></div></form><div class="sk-fading-circle spinner"><div class="sk-circle1 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle2 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle3 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle4 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle5 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle6 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle7 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle8 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle9 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle10 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle11 sk-circle"></div><div class="sk-circle12 sk-circle"></div></div><div class="form-success"><p class="headline">Thank you for your message!</p><p>We will get back to you soon.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"><div class="wrapper"><section class="disclaimer"><p>Take Me To Denmark does not represent an official guide of any sorts.
