After you find out you have been admitted/hired <strong>start looking for a place immediately</strong>. Even better, start looking around earlier so you can jump right in when the time comes. Especially if you plan on staying in a student housing you should sign up for waiting lists as soon as possible.</p><p>Majority of the websites you will encounter during your apartment hunt are going to be in Danish. Even when the site has an English version don't expect it to work properly all the time. Having a translator ready is handy when browsing offers. Google Chrome has a translating functionality built-in, or simply use <a href="http://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> or any other service of your choice.</p></article></div></div><main class="main" role="main"><div class="wrapper-small"><article class="article"><h2>Student housing</h2><p>You may be have experienced dorm life in your homecountry. Some of you may have even built an aversion to this kind of living arrangement, regardless of wether you lived in one or not. Rest assured, student housing in Denmark is of a very high standard. In most cases a student apartment means a <strong>1-room studio apartment with your own kitchen corner and bathroom</strong>. Dorms where you share a kitchen, bathroom or both with other students are ussualy arranged so the number of people sharing the same amenities is not very large – making cohabitation smoother and easier.</p><p>Student housing is definitely <strong>the cheapest housing option</strong>. Monthly rates start around roughly 1.700 DKK (for a room without kitchen or bathroom) and can go all the way up to 8.000 DKK for a fancy, newly built, 2-3 room apartment with all the necessary amenities. Majority of dorms will offer something in between. In Copenhagen, expect to pay somewhere between <strong>2.500-5.000 DKK</strong> for a standard studio apartment with kitchen corner and small bathroom. Besides being cheaper then other options, dorms also offer a very unique social and cultural dimension, which may be worth considering.</p><p>When you go to Denmark as a full-time bachelors/masters student, you are pretty much treated just like a Dane would be when it comes to getting a room in a dorm. No special treatment or jumping ahead in the line. This means you have to sign up for a waiting list (explained below) and hope to get to the front of the cue quickly. If you are going to Denmark <strong>as an exchange student you have a priority</strong> and you are basically guaranteed to get into some student housing facility. Some schools may offer some sort of assistance for their full-time students as well, but the general rule is that you are completely on your own on this one.</p><h4>Applying for a student apartment</h4><p>Majority of student apartments in dormitories (<em>kollegium</em> in Danish) are offered through centralized portals, which make signing up for waiting lists much easier and faster. &lt;sup id=&quot;facilities-anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#facilities&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1 independent facilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</p><p>First thing you want to do on the website(s) is to <strong>create your personal profile</strong>. The profile is the main part of your application. It consists of basic personal information about you, your education, your living preferences, your current living situation and other necessary information.</p><p>After creating your profile you can <strong>sign up for waiting lists</strong> for individual dormitories. Dorms fall into different categories (type A, type B…) which correspond to a approximate time it will take to get to the top of the waiting list. Waiting times can range anywhere from couple of months to 3 years.</p><p>It is not explicitly clear what information exactly affects your position on the waiting list. But if you indicate that you are currently in an urgent need of housing (=homeless) one could assume you will get to the top of the list faster. If you have trouble finding a place before arriving to Denmark there is a period during summer time when it's possible to sign up for urgent housing list (if you fulfill requirements). &lt;sup id=&quot;housing-office-anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#housing-office&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2 housing office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class=&quot;box important&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;box-title&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon-important&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Important&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be aware that if you for some reason decline a certain number of offers for a place in &lt;em&gt;kollegium&lt;/em&gt; you are going to get pushed down on the waiting list. So don't run around signing up for every dorm you see, even though you don't actually intend to live in them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class=&quot;box links&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;box-title&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Links&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kollegierneskontor.dk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;KKIK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - largest portal&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findbolig.nu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FindBolig&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - large portal (only in Danish) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ungdomsboliger.dk/?id=navigationskort&amp;lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ungdomsboliger.dk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.housinganywhere.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;HousingAnywhere.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - student-to-student &lt;em&gt;“housing platform for exchange and internship students”&lt;/em&gt; (you need a school email to be able to rent out) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;</p><p>&lt;div id=&quot;facilities&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;footnote-header&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;footnote-counter&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;Independent facilities&lt;a href=&quot;#facilities-anchor&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;(Back to text ↩)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are some facilities which operate outside these centralized systems.

It’s the quickest, you know where you stand right away, you get at least some sort of “negotiating power” and it increases your chances of scoring a place overall.</li><li><strong>Don't wait</strong> - If you see an ad which suits your needs act right away. Starting the negotiation process is just the beginning. You will have plenty of time to think stuff over before you are in the position to actually sign a rental agreement and move into the apartment.</li><li><strong>Ask locals</strong> - Ask friends who have lived in Denmark for a while to ask around for you. People will tell you again and again that your network and contacts give you the <strong>highest chance</strong> of finding a place.</li></ul><p>Numbers bellow apply for Copenhagen. &lt;sup id=&quot;cph-metropolitan-area-anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cph-metropolitan-area&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2 Copenhagen areas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If you are looking for a place in other cities, you can expect the prices to be lower.</p><p>There is a chance you will be lucky enough to find a place with a reasonable rent. However, generally be ready for high monthly rates. Rent for a cheap studio apartment can start around 3.500 DKK, but expect the rates for apartments to be more in the range of <strong>4.500-8.500 DKK</strong>.</p><p>Monthly rates for a room in an apartment shared with other people start somewhere around 2.500 DKK per month, but the odds are you will pay around <strong>3.000-5.000 DKK</strong>.</p><p>&lt;div class=&quot;box important&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;box-title&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon-important&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Important&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watch out for scammers. Ooh yes, plenty of wrong doers out there on Danish websites waiting for naive apartment hunters. You can ussualy tell that the ad is a scam if the pictures show a nice, well furnished apartment at a central location for a suspiciously low price – e.g. 2-room apartment at Christianshavn for 3.800 DKK. Some scams are better thought out then others. But if you do reply to a scam ad don't worry, it is pretty easy to tell it is a scam once the evil villain contacts you. These are things to look out for:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;response in English even though the ad was written in Danish&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;response is very long, explaining how the person moved to another country, but that they have a way of &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;they ask you to wire the money through Western Union or through some other form of &quot;untraceable&quot; transaction&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class=&quot;box important&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;box-title&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon-important&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Important&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NEVER EVER pay any money in advance&lt;/b&gt;. Not before you've seen the apartment with your own eyes and not before you've sorted out everything about the rental agreement. It is also advised &lt;b&gt;not to pay in cash&lt;/b&gt;, but with a bank transfer so the transaction can be traced. If the agreement is in Danish than getting it checked at a law firm or at least read through by native Danish speaker is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class=&quot;box links&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;box-title&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Links&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only larger websites advertise new offers on regular basis so don't be surprised if you see old ads on many of the websites.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;div class=&quot;box-heading&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;FREE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dba.dk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;dba.dk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - “The blue newspaper” (&lt;em&gt;Den Blå Avis&lt;/em&gt;), the largest online marketplace in Denmark. Think of it as a Danish eBay where you can find apartments and rooms for rent (besides other things). The website may seem a little chaotic at the beginning, but once you get used to it, it's pretty easy to find your way around. You will find two types of ads on the site. The ones which were added through DBA (&lt;em&gt;Private&lt;/em&gt;) and ones pointing to other sites (&lt;em&gt;Forhandlere&lt;/em&gt; = Dealer). Visit this website daily and act immediately upon seeing an ad matching your needs.

Even students own apartments; often through their parents or by getting a mortage. This is possible thanks to the concept of <em>Andelsbolig</em> (“coopearative apartmens”). Technically, you don‘t buy an apartment itself but you buy a share in the cooperative which runs and maintains the apartment building(s).&lt;sup id=&quot;andelsbolig-anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#andelsbolig&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1 andelsbolig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</p><p>With a relatively low initial investment (ranging anywhere from 160.000 DKK to 1.000.000+ DKK in greater Copenhagen area) and varying “monthly tax” fee, cooperatives provide individuals, couples and families with potentially most cost-effective solution in the long-run. Instead of throwing money into thin air by renting, you get an apartment of your choice and possibly turning a profit when you sell it later on.</p><p>The idea behind <em>Andelsbolig</em> is to provide affordable housing for people to live in. The apartments are meant to be occupied primarily by its owner. It is usually possible to sublet these apartmens for shorter periods of time. However, it‘s only short-term and owner should not make a significant profit. There are laws which regulate rents and tell you how long you can live outside the aparment. It depends on the rules of your cooperative as well.</p><p>&lt;div class=&quot;box important&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;box-title&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon-important&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Important&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be sure to consult matters cocerning buying an apartment with professionals. You need to get economony of the cooperative checked out and all the documents and rules examined. Bank is a good start if you are taking a mortage. Hiring a legal-adcovat/lawyer is always a good idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>If you have the necessary resources you should consider buying an apartment as one of the possibilities.

This purchase is not the same as buying property and you do not get the same tax-deductions and advantages as when buying a property, what you are buying is a share and the right to live in and use said property, you still pay houserent, although it is usually lower than an apartment houserent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Together with the other members you have to agree upon the upkeep of the building, the rules etc. You are also responsible for maintainance. And you are, together with the others, responsible for any debts in the property etc. This means that you have to be very careful and make sure that you buy a &quot;share&quot; in a economically sound &quot;andelsboligforening.&quot; If lots of houses/apartments in it are empty, then you will be paying for the upkeep and maintainance of these, and not just the one you are living in, and this can get expensive. Since you are also in a way becoming a member of a collective, it is important that you agree with the existing rules and get along with the other members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The original idea behind an &quot;Andelsbolig&quot; was to give the lower middle-class an opportunity for better housing with a lower houserent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While not entirely correct, you could say that it lies somewhere between renting and buying. So it has nothing to do with co-habitation as in 2 people sharing an apartment. You are multiple people with each your own apartment/house, sharing the combined property.”&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;/div&gt;</p><p>&lt;/div&gt;</p></article><article class="article"><h2>Short-term accomodation</h2><p>Your semester or first day at a new job is about to start and you have trouble finding a place prior to your arrival to Denmark? There are few temporal solutions out there. You can look for a place to live while you are already in Denmark.</p><p>There are many youth hostels in Copenhagen. They will cost you less then a hotel or bed-and-breakfast. However sleeping with 4+ people in one room and lack of privacy can get quite frustrating pretty quickly. It is a good short-term solution, but it's not recommended for stays longer than 1-3 weeks.</p><p>The most comfortable short-term solution is private apartment or a room. This option can get a bit pricey. However, if the situation demands it, it is still a way better and cheaper option than a hotel. You also get access to a proper kitchen, meaning you don't have to spend that much money on eating out.</p><p>&lt;div class=&quot;box links&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;box-title&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Links&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wimdu.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;wimdu.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - apartments and private rooms&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;airbnb.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - apartments and private rooms&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danhostel.dk/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;danhostel.dk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - hostels&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostelworld.com/hostels/Copenhagen/Denmark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;hostelworld.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - hostels&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostels.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;hostels.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - hostels&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bedandbreakfast.dk/?country=358&amp;language=13&amp;s=Denmark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;bedandbreakfast.dk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - hostels&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.couchsurfing.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;couchsurfing.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - crash on someone’s couch&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flat-club.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;flat-club.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - apartments and private rooms&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p></article></div></main><footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"></footer><!-- javascript global --><!-- JavaScript --><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/assets/js/vendor/jquery-1.12.4.min.js"><\/script>')</script><script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script><!-- Google Analytics --></body></html>
