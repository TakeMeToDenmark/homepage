Especially if you plan on staying in a student housing you should sign up for waiting lists as soon as possible.</p><p>Majority of the websites you will encounter during your apartment hunt are going to be in Danish.

It’s the quickest, you know where you stand right away, you get at least some sort of “negotiating power” and it increases your chances of scoring a place overall.</li><li><strong>Don&#39;t wait</strong> - If you see an ad which suits your needs act right away. Starting the negotiation process is just the beginning. You will have plenty of time to think stuff over before you are in the position to actually sign a rental agreement and move into the apartment.</li><li><strong>Ask locals</strong> - Ask friends who have lived in Denmark for a while to ask around for you. People will tell you again and again that your network and contacts give you the <strong>highest chance</strong> of finding a place.</li></ul><p>Numbers bellow apply for Copenhagen. <sup id="cph-metropolitan-area-anchor"><a href="#cph-metropolitan-area" class="footnote-ref">2 Copenhagen areas</a></sup> If you are looking for a place in other cities, you can expect the prices to be lower.</p><p>There is a chance you will be lucky enough to find a place with a reasonable rent. However, generally be ready for high monthly rates. Rent for a cheap studio apartment can start around 3.500 DKK, but expect the rates for apartments to be more in the range of <strong>4.500-8.500 DKK</strong>.</p><p>Monthly rates for a room in an apartment shared with other people start somewhere around 2.500 DKK per month, but the odds are you will pay around <strong>3.000-5.000 DKK</strong>.</p><div class="box important"><div class="box-title"><i class="icon-important"></i>Important</div><p>Watch out for scammers.

You can ussualy tell that the ad is a scam if the pictures show a nice, well furnished apartment at a central location for a suspiciously low price – e.g. 2-room apartment at Christianshavn for 3.800 DKK. Some scams are better thought out then others. But if you do reply to a scam ad don&#39;t worry, it is pretty easy to tell it is a scam once the evil villain contacts you.

Even students own apartments; often through their parents or by getting a mortage. This is possible thanks to the concept of <em>Andelsbolig</em> (“coopearative apartmens”). Technically, you don‘t buy an apartment itself but you buy a share in the cooperative which runs and maintains the apartment building(s).<sup id="andelsbolig-anchor"><a href="#andelsbolig" class="footnote-ref">1&nbsp;andelsbolig</a></sup></p><p>With a relatively low initial investment (ranging anywhere from 160.000 DKK to 1.000.000+ DKK in greater Copenhagen area) and varying “monthly tax” fee, cooperatives provide individuals, couples and families with potentially most cost-effective solution in the long-run. Instead of throwing money into thin air by renting, you get an apartment of your choice and possibly turning a profit when you sell it later on.</p><p>The idea behind <em>Andelsbolig</em> is to provide affordable housing for people to live in. The apartments are meant to be occupied primarily by its owner. It is usually possible to sublet these apartmens for shorter periods of time. However, it‘s only short-term and owner should not make a significant profit. There are laws which regulate rents and tell you how long you can live outside the aparment. It depends on the rules of your cooperative as well.</p><div class="box important"><div class="box-title"><i class="icon-important"></i>Important</div><p>Be sure to consult matters cocerning buying an apartment with professionals. You need to get economony of the cooperative checked out and all the documents and rules examined. Bank is a good start if you are taking a mortage. Hiring a legal-adcovat/lawyer is always a good idea.</p></div><p>If you have the necessary resources you should consider buying an apartment as one of the possibilities.

This purchase is not the same as buying property and you do not get the same tax-deductions and advantages as when buying a property, what you are buying is a share and the right to live in and use said property, you still pay houserent, although it is usually lower than an apartment houserent.</p><p>Together with the other members you have to agree upon the upkeep of the building, the rules etc. You are also responsible for maintainance. And you are, together with the others, responsible for any debts in the property etc. This means that you have to be very careful and make sure that you buy a &quot;share&quot; in a economically sound &quot;andelsboligforening.&quot; If lots of houses/apartments in it are empty, then you will be paying for the upkeep and maintainance of these, and not just the one you are living in, and this can get expensive. Since you are also in a way becoming a member of a collective, it is important that you agree with the existing rules and get along with the other members.</p><p>The original idea behind an &quot;Andelsbolig&quot; was to give the lower middle-class an opportunity for better housing with a lower houserent.</p><p>While not entirely correct, you could say that it lies somewhere between renting and buying. So it has nothing to do with co-habitation as in 2 people sharing an apartment. You are multiple people with each your own apartment/house, sharing the combined property.”</p></div><p></p></div><p></p></article><article class="article"><p>/<em> Title: Short-term accomodation Description: Tips and links for short-term housing options in Denmark Author: Ilja Date: 2014/06/29 Placing: 4 Hook: short-term-accomodation Template: article </em>/</p><p>Your semester or first day at a new job is about to start and you have trouble finding a place prior to your arrival to Denmark?

This option can get a bit pricey. However, if the situation demands it, it is still a way better and cheaper option than a hotel.
