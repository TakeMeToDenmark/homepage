<h2>Short-term accomodation</h2>
<p>Your semester or first day at a new job is about to start and you have trouble finding a place prior to your arrival to Denmark? There are few temporal solutions out there. You can look for a place to live while you are already in Denmark.</p>
<p>There are many youth hostels in Copenhagen. They will cost you less then a hotel or bed-and-breakfast. However sleeping with 4+ people in one room and lack of privacy can get quite frustrating pretty quickly. It is a good short-term solution, but it’s not recommended for stays longer than 1-3 weeks.</p>
<p>The most comfortable short-term solution is private apartment or a room. This option can get a bit pricey. However, if the situation demands it, it is still a way better and cheaper option than a hotel. You also get access to a proper kitchen, meaning you don’t have to spend that much money on eating out.</p>
