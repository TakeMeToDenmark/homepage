<h2>Student housing</h2>
<p>You may be have experienced dorm life in your homecountry. Some of you may have even built an aversion to this kind of living arrangement, regardless of wether you lived in one or not. Rest assured, student housing in Denmark is of a very high standard. In most cases a student apartment means a <strong>1-room studio apartment with your own kitchen corner and bathroom</strong>. Dorms where you share a kitchen, bathroom or both with other students are ussualy arranged so the number of people sharing the same amenities is not very large – making cohabitation smoother and easier.</p>
<p>Student housing is definitely <strong>the cheapest housing option</strong>. Monthly rates start around roughly 1.700 DKK (for a room without kitchen or bathroom) and can go all the way up to 8.000 DKK for a fancy, newly built, 2-3 room apartment with all the necessary amenities. Majority of dorms will offer something in between. In Copenhagen, expect to pay somewhere between <strong>2.500-5.000 DKK</strong> for a standard studio apartment with kitchen corner and small bathroom. Besides being cheaper then other options, dorms also offer a very unique social and cultural dimension, which may be worth considering.</p>
<p>When you go to Denmark as a full-time bachelors/masters student, you are pretty much treated just like a Dane would be when it comes to getting a room in a dorm. No special treatment or jumping ahead in the line. This means you have to sign up for a waiting list (explained below) and hope to get to the front of the cue quickly. If you are going to Denmark <strong>as an exchange student you have a priority</strong> and you are basically guaranteed to get into some student housing facility. Some schools may offer some sort of assistance for their full-time students as well, but the general rule is that you are completely on your own on this one.</p>
<h4>Applying for a student apartment</h4>
<p>Majority of student apartments in dormitories (<em>kollegium</em> in Danish) are offered through centralized portals, which make signing up for waiting lists much easier and faster. &lt;sup id=&quot;facilities-anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#facilities&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1 independent facilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</p>
<p>First thing you want to do on the website(s) is to <strong>create your personal profile</strong>. The profile is the main part of your application. It consists of basic personal information about you, your education, your living preferences, your current living situation and other necessary information.</p>
<p>After creating your profile you can <strong>sign up for waiting lists</strong> for individual dormitories. Dorms fall into different categories (type A, type B…) which correspond to a approximate time it will take to get to the top of the waiting list. Waiting times can range anywhere from couple of months to 3 years.</p>
<p>It is not explicitly clear what information exactly affects your position on the waiting list. But if you indicate that you are currently in an urgent need of housing (=homeless) one could assume you will get to the top of the list faster. If you have trouble finding a place before arriving to Denmark there is a period during summer time when it's possible to sign up for urgent housing list (if you fulfill requirements). &lt;sup id=&quot;housing-office-anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#housing-office&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2 housing office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</p>

&lt;div class=&quot;box-title&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;icon-important&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Important&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that if you for some reason decline a certain number of offers for a place in &lt;em&gt;kollegium&lt;/em&gt; you are going to get pushed down on the waiting list. So don't run around signing up for every dorm you see, even though you don't actually intend to live in them.&lt;/p&gt;
