<p>Finding a place to live in Copenhagen can be <strong>quite painful</strong>.  After you find out you have been admitted/hired <strong>start looking for a place immediately</strong>. Even better, start looking around earlier so you can jump right in when the time comes. Especially if you plan on staying in a student housing you should sign up for waiting lists as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Majority of the websites you will encounter during your apartment hunt are going to be in Danish. Even when the site has an English version don&#39;t expect it to work properly all the time. Having a translator ready is handy when browsing offers. Google Chrome has a translating functionality built-in, or simply use <a href="http://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> or any other service of your choice.</p>
