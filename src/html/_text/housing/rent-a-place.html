<p>Here are some general tips when looking for a place: <sup id="cbs-tips-anchor"><a href="#cbs-tips" class="footnote-ref">1 CBS tips</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If possible always call</strong> - If there is a phone number in the ad and it doesn’t say anything about how to contact the person then <strong>calling is always the best option</strong>. It’s the quickest, you know where you stand right away, you get at least some sort of “negotiating power” and it increases your chances of scoring a place overall.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#39;t wait</strong> - If you see an ad which suits your needs act right away. Starting the negotiation process is just the beginning. You will have plenty of time to think stuff over before you are in the position to actually sign a rental agreement and move into the apartment.</li>
<li><strong>Ask locals</strong> - Ask friends who have lived in Denmark for a while to ask around for you. People will tell you again and again that your network and contacts give you the <strong>highest chance</strong> of finding a place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Numbers bellow apply for Copenhagen. <sup id="cph-metropolitan-area-anchor"><a href="#cph-metropolitan-area" class="footnote-ref">2 Copenhagen areas</a></sup> If you are looking for a place in other cities, you can expect the prices to be lower.</p>
<p>There is a chance you will be lucky enough to find a place with a reasonable rent. However, generally be ready for high monthly rates. Rent for a cheap studio apartment can start around 3.500 DKK, but expect the rates for apartments to be more in the range of <strong>4.500-8.500 DKK</strong>.</p>
<p>Monthly rates for a room in an apartment shared with other people start somewhere around 2.500 DKK per month, but the odds are you will pay around <strong>3.000-5.000 DKK</strong>.</p>

<p>Watch out for scammers. Ooh yes, plenty of wrong doers out there on Danish websites waiting for naive apartment hunters. You can ussualy tell that the ad is a scam if the pictures show a nice, well furnished apartment at a central location for a suspiciously low price – e.g. 2-room apartment at Christianshavn for 3.800 DKK. Some scams are better thought out then others. But if you do reply to a scam ad don&#39;t worry, it is pretty easy to tell it is a scam once the evil villain contacts you. These are things to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>response in English even though the ad was written in Danish</li>
<li>response is very long, explaining how the person moved to another country, but that they have a way of </li>
<li>they ask you to wire the money through Western Union or through some other form of &quot;untraceable&quot; transaction</li>
</div>

<div class="box important">
<div class="box-title"><i class="icon-important"></i>Important</div>
<p><b>NEVER EVER pay any money in advance</b>. Not before you&#39;ve seen the apartment with your own eyes and not before you&#39;ve sorted out everything about the rental agreement. It is also advised <b>not to pay in cash</b>, but with a bank transfer so the transaction can be traced. If the agreement is in Danish than getting it checked at a law firm or at least read through by native Danish speaker is a good idea.</p>

<div class="box links">
<div class="box-title"><i class="icon-link"></i>Links</div>
<p>Only larger websites advertise new offers on regular basis so don&#39;t be surprised if you see old ads on many of the websites.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dba.dk/" target="_blank"><b>dba.dk</b></a> - “The blue newspaper” (<em>Den Blå Avis</em>), the largest online marketplace in Denmark. Think of it as a Danish eBay where you can find apartments and rooms for rent (besides other things). The website may seem a little chaotic at the beginning, but once you get used to it, it&#39;s pretty easy to find your way around. You will find two types of ads on the site. The ones which were added through DBA (<em>Private</em>) and ones pointing to other sites (<em>Forhandlere</em> = Dealer). Visit this website daily and act immediately upon seeing an ad matching your needs. Especially ads with a phone number tend to be rented out in the matter of hours if not minutes.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.boligportal.dk/" target="_blank"><b>boligportal.dk</b></a> - Probably the biggest rental portal out there. <b>If you have to pick only one site to pay for, make it this one.</b> If there is no phone number in the ad, the communication is handled through the website. Expect to wait couple of days for the response, also don&#39;t be surprised if you don&#39;t get any response at all.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lejebolig.dk/" target="_blank"><b>lejebolig.dk</b></a> - Definitely one of the more user-friendly and visually appealing websites out there. There has been some negative feedback on this website (too many scams), but the best is just to check it out for yourself. </li>
<li><a href="http://boligbasen.dk/" target="_blank"><b>boligbasen.dk</b></a> - One of the bigger sites.</li>
<li><a href="http://findroommate.dk/" target="_blank"><b>findroommate.dk</b></a> - Website aimed exclusively at people looking to live with someone. If you are deliberately looking to live with a roommate, then this website is definitely worth checking out.</li>

<p>There are numerous Facebook groups where people post apartments and rooms for rent. Bellow are some examples of these groups, you can find other ones by searching “<b>lejligheder til leje</b>” (apartments for rent) or “<b>værelser</b>” (rooms) through Facebook search.</p>

<p>Good guys at CBS have made this <a href="http://www.cbs.dk/en/international-opportunities/international-students/guides-international-students-cbs" target="_blank">nice list of tips for finding housing</a>.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we have had students who have been scammed by immoral people, so tips on finding housing on your own include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful if rent seems too low; it might be too good to be true</li>
<li>Choose several options that interest you and visit them all before making any decisions</li>
<li>Do not sign any contract before having seen the room or flat</li>
<li>If you have problems with your landlord, <a href="http://www.retshjaelpen.dk/eng/" target="_blank">contact Copenhagen Legal Aid</a> for help</li>
<li>Be aware that there are many older buildings in Copenhagen; some of them may have particular features like shared bathroom facilities with other flats</li>
<li>When inquiring about monthly rent, remember to also inquire about utilities (electricity, heating, water, etc.)</li>
<li>Inquire about house rules and other special terms of your rental agreement</li>
<li>Check that your rental agreement states the rental period and the conditions of notice</li>
<li>Do not accept illegal contracts and remember that you have to be able to register the address you are moving into (see section &quot;CPR number&quot;)</li>
<li>There are many good housing sites but be careful; when using fee payable portals, be sure that you understand the rules and methods of fee paying (automatically charged, single payment, etc.)</li>
<li>Check if you need to acquire home insurance! (see Anticipating Arrival Guide&#39;s section &quot;1.7. Insurance&quot;)”</li>

<p>Rents in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Municipality" target="_blank">Copenhagen Municipality</a> (ZIP codes 800-2500) are typically higher then for those in a wider metropolitan area outside the inner city – e.g. <em>Vanløse, Hellerup, Lyngby, Glostrup, Brondby, Hvidovre</em>. Besides being cheaper, the demand should be lower too. It depends on how much are you willing to commute to school/work everyday. <em>S-Train</em> (regional train) is a pretty fast and efficient means of transport, so you can get downtown in under 30-60min from most suburban areas.</p>
