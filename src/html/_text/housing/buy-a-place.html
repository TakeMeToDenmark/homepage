<h2>Buying a place</h2>
<p>It’s common for people in Denmark to buy property. Even students own apartments; often through their parents or by getting a mortage. This is possible thanks to the concept of <em>Andelsbolig</em> (“coopearative apartmens”). Technically, you don‘t buy an apartment itself but you buy a share in the cooperative which runs and maintains the apartment building(s).&lt;sup id=&quot;andelsbolig-anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#andelsbolig&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1 andelsbolig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</p>
<p>With a relatively low initial investment (ranging anywhere from 160.000 DKK to 1.000.000+ DKK in greater Copenhagen area) and varying “monthly tax” fee, cooperatives provide individuals, couples and families with potentially most cost-effective solution in the long-run. Instead of throwing money into thin air by renting, you get an apartment of your choice and possibly turning a profit when you sell it later on.</p>
<p>The idea behind <em>Andelsbolig</em> is to provide affordable housing for people to live in. The apartments are meant to be occupied primarily by its owner. It is usually possible to sublet these apartmens for shorter periods of time. However, it‘s only short-term and owner should not make a significant profit. There are laws which regulate rents and tell you how long you can live outside the aparment. It depends on the rules of your cooperative as well.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to consult matters cocerning buying an apartment with professionals. You need to get economony of the cooperative checked out and all the documents and rules examined. Bank is a good start if you are taking a mortage. Hiring a legal-adcovat/lawyer is always a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</p>

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Voelven for posting this well-written &lt;a href=&quot;https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120806230835AAg87wo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;explanation of what is &lt;em&gt;andelsbolig&lt;/em&gt; on Yahoo Answers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[…] andelsbolig is when you buy a share/become a member of an &quot;Andelsboligforening&quot;. This purchase is not the same as buying property and you do not get the same tax-deductions and advantages as when buying a property, what you are buying is a share and the right to live in and use said property, you still pay houserent, although it is usually lower than an apartment houserent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with the other members you have to agree upon the upkeep of the building, the rules etc. You are also responsible for maintainance. And you are, together with the others, responsible for any debts in the property etc. This means that you have to be very careful and make sure that you buy a &quot;share&quot; in a economically sound &quot;andelsboligforening.&quot; If lots of houses/apartments in it are empty, then you will be paying for the upkeep and maintainance of these, and not just the one you are living in, and this can get expensive. Since you are also in a way becoming a member of a collective, it is important that you agree with the existing rules and get along with the other members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original idea behind an &quot;Andelsbolig&quot; was to give the lower middle-class an opportunity for better housing with a lower houserent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not entirely correct, you could say that it lies somewhere between renting and buying. So it has nothing to do with co-habitation as in 2 people sharing an apartment. You are multiple people with each your own apartment/house, sharing the combined property.”&lt;/p&gt;</p>
