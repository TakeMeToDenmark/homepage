<h1>Study in Denmark</h1>
<p>Denmark puts a lot of money into education. As a result the overall quality and level of schools here is very high. Students are well cared for and cities are swarming with them. Many universities offer programs taught in English. This makes Denmark a lucrative location for international students too.</p>
