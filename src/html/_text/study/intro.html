<h2 id="study-in-denmark">Study in Denmark</h2>
<p>Denmark pours a lot of money into education. As a result the overall quality and level of schools in Denmark is very high. Students are taken good care of and cities are full of them. Many schools offer programs taught in English, because of that Denmark is a very lucrative location for international students too. <strong>If you are from EU/EEA,  Switzerland or if you are an exchange student you don&#39;t pay anything for your studies</strong> (information about tuition fees for non-EU citizens are below).</p>
<p>The instructions here apply to bachelor programs. Through provided links you should be able to find information about applying for master, exchange and other types of programs as well.</p>
