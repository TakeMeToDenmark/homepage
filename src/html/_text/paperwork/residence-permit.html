<p>You have to apply for a residence permit <strong>BEFORE</strong> your arrival to Denmark – that means you should already have a permit when entering Denmark. You submit the application through Danish embassy or consulate in your country of residence. You have to pay a processing fee to the <em>Danish Immigration Service</em> (1670 DKK as of time of writing). Bear in mind that you will probably also have to pay a fee to your local authority and a bank transaction fee.</p>

<p>You usually apply when you arrive to Denmark. You can submit your application personally by visiting the Regional State Administration (‘<em>Statsforvaltningen</em>’ in Danish), by post/email or through Danish representation in your country – last two options can be done prior to your arrival to Denmark. Regardless of which method you choose, you need to provide following supporting materials:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a clear copy of your passport or other valid travel document with picture</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 passport photograph</strong></li>
<li><strong>documentation of your enrollment in school or employer‘s declaration</strong> (or other depending on the reasons you are moving to Denmark - find more info throught the links provided below)</li>
</ul>
<p>When visiting a Regional State Administration personally, you must always bring your original passport or other valid travel document. Your registration certificate will arrive in a form of a letter.  You will need this certificate in order to apply for the CPR number (see below).</p>
