# Your guide for life in Denmark

Moving to Denmark involves a number of things you need to do and remember. You can find many websites and tutorials out there but information there tends to be overwhelming, too specialized and ultimately makes you worry about things that don't really matter.

Take Me To Denmak offers practical tips, short guides and general information about life in this lovely scandinavian country. The site is aimed primarely at people interested in living in Denmark long-term, but if you are just visiting you might find a lot of information here useful as well.
