# Find a place to live in Denmark
Finding a place to live in Copenhagen can be **quite painful**.  After you find out you have been admitted/hired **start looking for a place immediately**. Even better, start looking around earlier so you can jump right in when the time comes. Especially if you plan on staying in a student housing you should sign up for waiting lists as soon as possible.

Majority of the websites you will encounter during your apartment hunt are going to be in Danish. Even when the site has an English version don't expect it to work properly all the time. Having a translator ready is handy when browsing offers. Google Chrome has a translating functionality built-in, or simply use [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/) or any other service of your choice.
