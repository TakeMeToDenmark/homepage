## Before applying

The first step is to pick your school(s) and program(s). You are allowed to apply for **up to 8 programs** but you have to prioritize your choices. You can choose from a list of schools and pick your desired program or browse a list of available programs first and then choose a school. Pick wise young padawan!

Application process, entry requirements, necessary documentation (high school diploma, proof of english proficiency, etc.) and other formalities depend on a school and a program you choose, so you have to find out details for yourself.

::: important
Before starting an application process check which documentation has to be **officially certified**. Some schools may require certified translations of documents that are not in English or Danish. So make sure you got those ready some time ahead of the deadline.
