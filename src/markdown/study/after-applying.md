## After applying

The response times depend on requirements of your school and on additional enclosures to be sent after the deadline (e.g. high school diploma). You may get a letter of acceptance sooner but normally, as an internatioanl student, expect the answer around summer time (June-August).

While you are impatiently waiting, you can slowly – or quickly, if you are super excited about moving out from parents – start looking around for living and other moving arrangements. If you plan on staying in student housing facility then you should start signing up on waiting lists **NOW!**
