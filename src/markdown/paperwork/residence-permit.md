## Getting a residence permit

Everyone staying in Denmark for more than 3 months needs to apply for either a *residence permit* or a *registration certificate* – no later than 3 months following your entry.

When and how you have to apply depends on what is your country of citizenship. Following table shows you when to apply. Below you will find brief instructions for each category.

### Non-EU/EEA citizens
You have to apply for a residence permit **BEFORE** your arrival to Denmark – that means you should already have a permit when entering Denmark. You submit the application through Danish embassy or consulate in your country of residence. You have to pay a processing fee to the *Danish Immigration Service* (1670 DKK as of time of writing). Bear in mind that you will probably also have to pay a fee to your local authority and a bank transaction fee.

#### EU/EEA or Swiss citizens
You usually apply when you arrive to Denmark. You can submit your application personally by visiting the Regional State Administration (‘*Statsforvaltningen*’ in Danish), by post/email or through Danish representation in your country – last two options can be done prior to your arrival to Denmark. Regardless of which method you choose, you need to provide following supporting materials:

- **a clear copy of your passport or other valid travel document with picture**
- **1 passport photograph**
- **documentation of your enrollment in school or employer‘s declaration** (or other depending on the reasons you are moving to Denmark - find more info throught the links provided below)

When visiting a Regional State Administration personally, you must always bring your original passport or other valid travel document. Your registration certificate will arrive in a form of a letter.  You will need this certificate in order to apply for the CPR number (see below).
