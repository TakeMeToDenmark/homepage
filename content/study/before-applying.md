The first step is to pick your school(s) and program(s). You are allowed to apply for **up to 8 programs**, however, you have to prioritize your choices. You can start picking your desired program by visiting the list of schools. Or maybe you prefer to browse the list of available programs first and choose the school afterwards. In either case, pick wise young padawan!
