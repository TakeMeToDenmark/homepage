In 2012 this website has dramatically changed the life of its creator by helping him get accepted to a university in Denmark. Intrigued by the catchy domain name he decided to help others find their way into this idyllic Scandinavian country.

So what is this all about?

Well, to be honest, there is no grand plan behind the project. What you currently see on the website are descriptions of the most essential procedures for moving to and studying in Denmark. However, the website’s long-term ambition is to provide people with information about pretty much anything related to living and visiting Denmark.

What sets TakeMeToDenmark.com apart from other websites with similar focus is the fact that there are no hidden motives and no single organization running the things in the background. The basic principle of the website is dead simple – **by people for people**.

The idea is to get everyone to chip in – be it a person who spent his entire life in Denmark or a lonely traveler who just happened to pass by – if you have an experience or a story to share this is the place to do so.

So if you would like to get your hands dirty and help out with the website [check out the ‘Get involved’ section](%base_url%/get-involved). If you can’t find something on the website – and let’s be honest, the chances are you can’t – than please [shoot us an email](mailto:hello@takemetodenmark.com) or <a href="https://iljapanic.typeform.com/to/ykMLFM" target="_blank">answer our short survey</a>.

***God dag!***
