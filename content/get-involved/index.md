The long term ambition of TakeMeToDenmark.com is to become an ultimate crowd-sourced collection of useful information for visiting, moving and living in Denmark. Anyone who has something to share about his/her experience with this lovely scandinavian country is encouraged to do so here. As long as you have something to say and it's at least loosely-related to Denmark it can get published here.  

Following are some examples of things you could help out with. Please don’t constrain yourselvs with those categories. They only illustrate type of tasks that need to be done for the website in near future. You can do one of them or all of them if you have the courage and energy for it – anything that benefits the project and its audience is welcomed and appreciated.
